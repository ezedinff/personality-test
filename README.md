# Personality Test

This is a personality test that I made to became builder at TeamWay. It's a simple test that will tell you what kind of person you are. It's not a very accurate test, but it's fun to take.


## How to run the project
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ezedinff/personality-test.git

$ cd personality-test

$ yarn install

$ yarn start
```

## How to run the tests
```bash
$ yarn test
```
